def cross_validation(model, X, y, nFolds):
    """
    Perform cross-validation on a given machine learning model to evaluate its performance.

    This function manually implements n-fold cross-validation if a specific number of folds is provided.
    If nFolds is set to -1, Leave One Out (LOO) cross-validation is performed instead, which uses each
    data point as a single test set while the rest of the data serves as the training set.

    Parameters:
    - model: scikit-learn-like estimator
        The machine learning model to be evaluated. This model must implement the .fit() and .score() methods
        similar to scikit-learn models.
    - X: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The input features to be used for training and testing the model.
    - y: array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        The target values (class labels in classification, real numbers in regression) for the input samples.
    - nFolds: int
        The number of folds to use for cross-validation. If set to -1, LOO cross-validation is performed.

    Returns:
    - mean_score: float
        The mean score across all cross-validation folds.
    - std_score: float
        The standard deviation of the scores across all cross-validation folds, indicating the variability
        of the score across folds.

    Example:
    --------
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

    # Generate a synthetic dataset
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize a kNN model
    model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

    # Perform 5-fold cross-validation
    mean_score, std_score = cross_validation(model, X, y, nFolds=5)

    print(f'Mean CV Score: {mean_score}, Std Deviation: {std_score}')
